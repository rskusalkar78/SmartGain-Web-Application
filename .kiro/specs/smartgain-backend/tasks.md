## Notes

- Tasks marked with `*` are optional and can be skipped for faster MVP
- Each task references specific requirements for traceability
- Property-based tests use fast-check library with minimum 100 iterations
- Checkpoints ensure incremental validation and early error detection
- Integration tasks ensure all components work together seamlessly
